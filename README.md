# Thin Ice Breaker

Breaking through the complexity of autonomous control systems and computer vision.

## What's Inside

### Control Systems
Advanced algorithms for autonomous robotics:

- **PID Temperature Controller** - Feedback control with integral action eliminating steady-state error
- **Kalman Filter** - Optimal sensor fusion reducing measurement noise from ±2m to 0.1m accuracy
- **A* Pathfinding** - Heuristic-based navigation with 8-way movement and obstacle avoidance
- **LQR Cart-Pole Balancer** - Optimal control theory for dynamic system stabilization

### Computer Vision
Image processing algorithms built from first principles:

- **Sobel Edge Detection** - Implemented from scratch using convolution and gradient operators
- **Real Image Processing** - Tested on real photographs with adjustable thresholding

## Technical Stack

**Languages:** Python, Bash  
**Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pillow  
**Concepts:** Control theory, state estimation, graph algorithms, computer vision, linear algebra

## Approach

No black boxes - every algorithm implemented from mathematical foundations to understand HOW and WHY they work, not just that they work.

## Purpose

Building the technical foundation for:
- Autonomous agricultural systems in Nigeria
- Efficient, scalable food production
- Eventually, space infrastructure and extraterrestrial manufacturing
